		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>I love pokemon! I'm not really the greatest trainer in the world, but I am definitely a fan! My favorite Pokemon are Pikachu and Ninetails. I like Pikachu because of episode 1 in the Pokemon series. He made a lasting impression and I felt like I could relate to him in a lot of ways. Ninetails I like because I really think he looks pretty awesome, even though he's definitely not one of the stronger Pokemon.

		<br>
		<p>Another thing I enjoy is Computer Programming. I think it is so cool that I can type in some code into my computer and it will display stuff back to me. I do admit that it is frustrating when your code has a bug and it takes hours to try and fix it, but the feeling you get when it finally runs correctly is absolutely amazing. I am excited to learn more about Computer Science!</p>
